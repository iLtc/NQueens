# NQueens

This is the final project of the Heuristic Problem Solving class at New York University. It is an online game made with jQuery and D3.

Click [here](http://nqueens.iltc.app/) to play the game online.

## Basic Rule

The game allows up to four players to play at the same time. Each player takes turns to place a queen on the chessboard.

No two queens are allowed on the same row, same column, or same diagonal.

The player who cannot place a queen on the chessboard anymore loses the game.

## Team Mode

If the Team Mode is on, queens placed by the same player will be on the same team and will not kill each other.
